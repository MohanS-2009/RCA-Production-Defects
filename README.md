üõ†Ô∏è Production Defects: A 5 Whys & Root Cause Analysis Dashboard

  A structured diagnostic dashboard and root cause analysis presentation that uncovers the underlying issues behind rising production defects on the assembly line using data-driven insights and actionable recommendations.

üìå Purpose

  This project aims to identify and address the increasing number of defective products in the assembly line through a systematic 5 Whys Analysis. It leverages feedback, process inspection, and data analysis to uncover root causes and propose actionable solutions that enhance efficiency and reduce waste.

üß∞ Tech Stack

    ‚Ä¢  Gamma App ‚Äì Used for designing an interactive, visual presentation.

    ‚Ä¢  Data Analysis Techniques ‚Äì Historical trend analysis, worker feedback, and inspection reports.

    ‚Ä¢  5 Whys Root Cause Methodology ‚Äì Framework for identifying the true source of recurring issues.

    ‚Ä¢  File Format ‚Äì PDF for presentation and documentation.

üìÇ Data Sources

    ‚Ä¢  Internal production defect logs and assembly reports

    ‚Ä¢  Feedback collected from assembly line workers

    ‚Ä¢  Inspection reports from machines and process evaluations

üîç Features & Highlights

Business Problem

  The company has been experiencing an increasing number of defective products, leading to elevated costs and operational inefficiencies. The issue is rooted in inconsistent training and prioritization of client deadlines over internal development.

Goal of the Dashboard

To perform a clear, visual root cause analysis that helps stakeholders:

    ‚Ä¢  Understand why defects are happening.

    ‚Ä¢  Identify where process gaps exist.

    ‚Ä¢  Implement long-term solutions through training, QA, and process improvement.

Walkthrough of Key Insights

    ‚Ä¢  5 Whys Analysis pinpoints lack of training caused by management's focus on urgent client deliveries.

    ‚Ä¢  Data Analysis reveals correlations between defect spikes and missed training cycles.

    ‚Ä¢  Worker Feedback surfaces challenges faced on the assembly line.

    ‚Ä¢  Inspection Reports highlight calibration and mechanical issues contributing to the problem.

Proposed Solutions

    ‚Ä¢  Periodic and mandatory training programs for all assembly workers

    ‚Ä¢  A balanced approach between training schedules and production deadlines

    ‚Ä¢  Enhanced quality assurance with automation and checklists

    ‚Ä¢  Employee empowerment through feedback collection and reward systems

Business Impact & Expected Outcomes

    ‚Ä¢  Significant reduction in defects and rework

    ‚Ä¢  Lowered production costs and material waste

    ‚Ä¢  Improved efficiency and smoother production workflow

    ‚Ä¢  Better employee engagement and ownership in quality
